## Interactive Theorem Prover for LK and LJ (for now)

This is what's powering https://www.hedonisticlearning.com/logic/

This is very similar to [Logitext](http://logitext.mit.edu/main), which I recommend, but it runs entirely
in the browser with no backend. Another difference is that it allows you to save a link to a proof
at any state.
